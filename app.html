              <ul>
                <li>During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers.</li>
                <li>He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches:</li>
                  <ol><li>The Applications of Probability to Cryptography</li> <li>Paper on Statistics of Repetitions</li></ol>
                <li>He ws a talented runner and tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team but was hampered by an injury.</li>
                <li>He specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe, which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish <em>bomba kryptologiczna.</em></li>
                <li>In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the German naval indicator system.</li>
                <li>He assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices.</li>
                <li>In the latter part of the war, he moved to work for the Secret Service's Radio Security Service.</li>
                <li>He designed the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory.</li>

              <h3><u>The Turing Test</u></h3>
              <p>Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed an experiment that became known as the Turing test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called "intelligent". The idea was that a computer could be said to "think" if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being. In the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind, it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet; the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer.</p>

              <h3><u>Personal Life</u></h3>
              <p>In January 1952, Turing, then 39, started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before Christmas outside the Regal Cinema when walking down Manchester's Oxford Road and invited him to lunch. On 23 January, Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time, and both men were charged with "gross indecency" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885.</p>
              <p>Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation, which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option of treatment via injections. Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946, though he kept his academic job. He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952.</p>

             <h3><u>Death</u></h3>
             <p>On 8 June 1954, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A post-mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide, it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954.</p>

              <h3><u>Official Pardon & Apology</u></h3>
              <p>In August 2009, British programmer John Graham-Cumming started a petition urging the British government to apologise for Turing's prosecution as a homosexual. The petition received more than 30,000 signatures. The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, acknowledged the petition, releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apologising and describing the treatment of Turing as "appalling":</p>
              <blockquote>
                <em>Thousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated. While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can't put the clock back, his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him ... So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's work I am very proud to say: we're sorry, you deserved so much better.</em>
